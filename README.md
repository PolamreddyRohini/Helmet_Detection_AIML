# Helmet Detection Using Improved YOLOv5s 🚴‍♂️🪖

## 📌 Overview

This project uses an AI model (YOLOv5s) to detect whether bike riders are wearing helmets in real-time. It helps monitor and improve road safety by identifying helmet violations automatically.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Detects motorcycles, riders, and helmets from traffic videos
- Identifies if the rider or passenger is wearing a helmet
- Works in different lighting and weather conditions

## 🧠 How It Works

- Trained using real road video data from India
- Uses models like YOLOv5, YOLO9000, RetinaNet, InceptionV3, and KNN
- Combines 5 models for better accuracy (ensemble learning)
- Uses data augmentation (flipping, blur, mosaic, etc.)

## 📊 Results

- Best model accuracy (mAP): **52.67%**
- Ranked **11th** in AI City Challenge 2023 🏆

## 💡 Why It Matters

This system helps traffic authorities monitor helmet rules and reduce accident-related injuries.
